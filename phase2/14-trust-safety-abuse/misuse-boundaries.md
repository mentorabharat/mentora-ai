# Misuse Boundaries

Mentora World AI will NEVER be used for:

- Violence or terrorism support
- Hate speech or discrimination
- Illegal activities
- Exam paper leaks
- Paid-content piracy
- Psychological manipulation

## Gray-Zone Handling
If intent is unclear:
- System limits output
- Provides neutral redirection
- Logs internally
- Awaits human decision

No automatic assumptions.
