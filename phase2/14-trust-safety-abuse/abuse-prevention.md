# Abuse Prevention Framework

Mentora prevents abuse without harming genuine learners.

## Prevented Behaviors
- Content misuse
- Misinformation spread
- Exam cheating facilitation
- Harassment or hate
- System gaming attempts

## How Prevention Works
- Boundary-based rules (not reactive bans)
- Pattern awareness (not spying)
- Progressive restriction (not instant removal)
- Human review before permanent action

## Explicit Rule
AI may FLAG potential abuse.
AI may NOT punish or ban.
