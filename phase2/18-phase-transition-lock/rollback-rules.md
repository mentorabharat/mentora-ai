# Rollback & Safety Rules

If any future change causes:
- Ethical risk
- Legal risk
- Trust erosion
- System instability

Then:
- Feature is rolled back immediately
- Users are protected
- AI agents revert to safe mode
- Founder review is mandatory

Rollback is always preferred over forced continuation.
