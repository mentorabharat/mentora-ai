# Phase-3 Boundaries

Phase-3 is allowed to:
- Add UI, UX, and interaction layers
- Add learning content (IT, Exams, Languages)
- Add AI logic implementations
- Add analytics dashboards

Phase-3 is NOT allowed to:
- Modify JSON Canonical schemas
- Change AI authority rules
- Alter ethics, payment, or trust principles
- Introduce AI decision-making without human veto

Phase-3 must respect Phase-2 as immutable foundation.
