# Block-09: JSON Canonical Data Layer

This block defines the Single Source of Truth for Mentora World AI.

All education systems, exams, IT learning, languages, AI agents,
and future features must derive their structure from canonical JSON data.

Core Principles:
- JSON owns logic
- UI renders JSON
- AI consumes JSON
- Humans approve JSON

No feature, content, or AI behavior is allowed without mapping to this layer.

Status: LOCK-IN-PROGRESS Humans approve JSON
