# AI Agent Architecture — Mentora World AI

Mentora World AI uses a controlled
multi-agent architecture.

## Agent Design Rules
- Agents are task-specific
- Agents are stateless
- Agents do not self-learn
- Agents operate under orchestration

## Example Agent Types
- Content Draft Agent
- Explanation Agent
- Language Support Agent
- Research Assistant Agent

## Control Flow
Human → Orchestrator → Agent → Human Review
