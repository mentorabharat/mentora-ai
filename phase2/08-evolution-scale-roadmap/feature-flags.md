# Feature Flags & Controlled Activation

All features in Mentora World AI are gated by feature flags.

Principles:
- Feature exists ≠ Feature active
- Flags are controlled manually
- Country-wise flags allowed
- Role-based flags allowed

AI role:
- AI may suggest flags
- AI cannot toggle flags

Outcome:
Safe experimentation without public damage.
