# Transparency Principles

Mentora World AI follows these transparency principles:

1. Users must understand WHAT the system does
2. Users must understand WHY a suggestion is given (at a high level)
3. AI never operates as a black box authority
4. Human oversight is always present
5. Transparency must not expose system vulnerabilities
6. Privacy is never sacrificed for transparency

Transparency is for trust, not for control or exploitation.
