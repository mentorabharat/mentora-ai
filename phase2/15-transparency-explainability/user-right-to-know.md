# User Right to Know

Every user has the right to know:

- That AI is involved
- The role of AI vs human
- The limits of AI authority
- How decisions are guided

Users do NOT have the right to:
- Demand internal AI logic
- Access other users’ data
- Manipulate AI behavior

Right to know ≠ right to control the system.
