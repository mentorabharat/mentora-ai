# Language Architecture — Mentora World AI

Mentora World AI is designed to support
the world's ~7100 languages over time.

## Core Rule
Language is a layer, NOT the core system.

Education logic remains the same.
Language only changes presentation.

## Language Readiness Levels (LRL)

- LRL-0: Not supported
- LRL-1: Static translation only
- LRL-2: Guided explanations
- LRL-3: Learning content support
- LRL-4: Mentorship & guidance
- LRL-5: Native-level experience

## Phase-2 Scope
- Architecture ready for all languages
- Active languages:
  - Marathi
  - Hindi
  - English

## Cultural Localization
- Language ≠ Culture
- Cultural flags handled separately
- No forced localization

Status: LOCKED
