# Growth Visibility Lock Decision

User growth data in Mentora World AI is strictly private.

## Rules

1. No public user count
2. No visible visitor numbers
3. No popularity metrics
4. No engagement scores shown to users

## Visibility

- Growth data is visible only to:
  - Founder
  - Authorized system intelligence (future)

## Reason

Public growth metrics distort learning behavior and decision-making.
Mentora prioritizes educational value over perceived popularity.

## Future Provision

Growth metrics may be selectively disclosed only to:
- Institutions
- Auditors
- Strategic partners

Students and mentors will never see platform-wide growth numbers.

Status: PERMANENTLY LOCKED
