# Growth Signals (Internal Only)

## Allowed Signals (Invisible to Users)

- Topic revisit frequency
- Time spent on a topic
- Return users (not total users)
- Content completion rate
- Language preference trend
- IT vs Exam interest shift

## Disallowed Signals (Never Used)

- Public user count
- Likes / stars / followers
- Leaderboards
- Trending labels

Growth signals are inputs, not outputs.
